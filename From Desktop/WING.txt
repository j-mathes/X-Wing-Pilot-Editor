X-Wing : B-Wing Missions

B-Wing Mission Disk for X-Wing
------------------------------

On the Historic Mission 6,in which you fly the B-Wing,in the Death 
Star trench run.  There are regular blasts of big lasers.  When they 
happen duck into the trench and keep on doing this.  Also if you 
miss, when you shoot the proton torps.  You have to quit the mission 
and play it again.  You can't just go round for another pass.  Even 
if you hit, it will not say "NICE SHOT!!".


B-Wing a Load of Hacks
----------------------

1.Hacks
=======
Here is a load of hacks for B-Wing but make sure that you have the 
original disks handy, just in case anything goes drastically wrong.
   
First, back up bflight.ovl to bflight.old. Open the file bflight.ovl 
using a hex editor such as PC Tools. For unlimited missiles on all 
fighters go to address 132A0. Find the sequence: FE 8F 13 01 and 
change it to: 90 90 90 90.  This is useful when you have lots of 
corvettes and frigates to destroy.

The hacks to increase the strength of your shields are different for
each fighter. Find the following sequences and change them to: 

98 3A 98 3A 04 00 34 08

FIGHTER         ADDRESS                 SEQUENCE
X-Wing          2C370                   C4 09 C4 09 04 00 34 08
Y-Wing          2C450                   A6 0E A6 0E 04 00 68 10
A-Wing          2C530                   C4 09 C4 09 04 00 DC 05
B-Wing          2D250                   88 13 88 13 04 00 9C 18

When you're playing, the shields will take some time to charge. 
Obviously you want to charge both shields and lasers to maximum. 
Divert power from the laser to the shield to speed things up. This 
will slow the fighter down but you can increase speed and 
acceleration by changing the following sequence to: F4 01 63 

FIGHTER         ADDRESS                 SEQUENCE
X-Wing          2C380                   E1 00 0C
Y-Wing          2C480                   B4 00 08
A-Wing          2C540                   0E 01 10
B-Wing          2D260                   CD 00 0C

Save the changes and exit. Copy bflight.ovl (the newly changed one) 
to bflight.cht. If you want the play the original, unhacked version 
copy bflight.old to bflight.ovl. If you want to play the cheat copy 
then copy bflight.ovl. If you're still hopeless even with a 
super-charged B-Wing then this final hack will slow the Imperial 
forces down to a snail's pace. Open the hacked bflight.cht and change 
the following sequences to: 19 00 0A. That should help some.

FIGHTER         ADDRESS                 SEQUENCE
TIE/F           2C620                   E1 00 FF
TIE/I           2C700                   FA 00 10        
TIE/B           2C7E0                   B4 00 0A       
TIE/A           2D180                   45 01 00
ASS GUN         C8C0                    C8 00 0C

*Well that's IT!*
