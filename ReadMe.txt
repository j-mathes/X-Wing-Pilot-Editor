Introduction

The X-Wing Pilot Editor is a utility that will allow you to edit pilot files for the LucasArts game "X-Wing '98".  As of this writing, the program has been tested on both x86 and x64 versions of Windows 7, 8.1, and 10.

Using the program should be self-explanatory.  To change an existing pilot file, simply load it using the File Open icon on the tool bar.  Just like the game, your pilot's name is taken from the file name.  If you want to change the name, just save the file with a different file name.  To create a new pilot file, use the File New icon on the tool bar.  Saving a file using the icon on the tool bar will always prompt you for a file name.  If you choose the same name, you will overwrite your existing pilot file.  There is no automatic backup feature.

Changeable data values should have names that closely resemble their corresponding name in the game itself.

Notes

- This program will only edit pilot files compatible with X-Wing '98.  It will not automatically convert different formats.
