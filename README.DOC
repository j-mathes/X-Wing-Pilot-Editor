Thank you for taking the time to try Universal Game Editor.

Universal Game Editor is a program designed to edit SAVED GAMES.  This
shareware release comes with five pre-configured MODULES that can be used to
edit four different games.  These games are Civilization, Betrayal at Krondor,
Master of Orion (2 MODULES) and Lands of Lore.  This shareware release is
fully functional, and is not crippled in any way.

This program will allow you to change many aspects of your games.  Military
unit strengths and weaknesses may be adjusted in wargames.  Character skills
and attributes may be changed in role-playing games.  In fact, almost any
game that allows you to save your game is a candidate for editing.
