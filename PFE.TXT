There is no fixed registration fee attached to PFE, how much you send is
entirely up to you.  However, anyone sending œ10 or more will be sent
the next release of PFE free of charge, so don't forget to send details
of your address and required disk size.  In addition I will consider the
first 10 reports of a bug as a œ10 donation and the same for suggestions
that get implemented in a subsequent release of PFE.


What Is PFE?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PFE is an editor for saved pilot files for the LucasArts game "X-Wing",
and also supports the "Imperial Pursuit" mission disk.  At a basic level
it allows the user to edit any aspect of a pilot's performance log as
required.  However it is intended to allow users to skip any difficult
missions and make up for deficiencies in X-Wing program, namely ships
captured are not recorded, nor are the destruction of mines/probes: I
killed it, so I want it in my log!!!

Also included is a pilot file called IPTOPACE.PLT.  This is an enhanced
version of the TOPACE.PLT file included in "Imperial Pursuit" that adds
the "Imperial Pursuit" missions to those completed.


Using PFE
~~~~~~~~~

Using PFE should be simple, however, just in case...

Starting PFE
    PFE accepts the FULL name of a pilot file on the command line, ie:
    "PFE iptopace.plt" or will prompt for one if it is not given.  Both
    options can be used with a path if required, although I recommend 
    placing PFE in your X-Wing directory to dispense with this.

Editing Your Pilot File
    Assuming no errors occurred in opening the pilot file you will now
    see the PFE editing screen with a flashing cursor by the "Status"
    entry.  You may now use the keys listed in the following section to
    make any required changes to your file.  Remember that if you make
    a mistake you can simply correct it or abandon your changes.

PFE Key Summary
    Cursor keys:    Move the cursor  ;^)
    F1 - F4:        Switch editing screen
    F5:             Exit with option to discard changes
    +/-:            Increment / decrement value
    Numeric keys:   Input new numeric value directly (see Note #1)
    Page Up / Down: Change tour being edited

Exiting PFE
    To exit PFE press the "F5" key.  You will now be asked whether to
    save your work (press "S"), abandon it (press "A") or continue your
    editing (press any other key)

Notes
    *   Numeric keys cannot be used to change the last maze level that
        was completed, use the +/- keys instead.
    *   Some values cannot exceed 65,535.  If you enter a value greater
        than this is will be rounded down.
    *   In the interests of screen design I have put an arbitrary limit
        of 999,999 onto mission scores which is sufficient to display
        all *realistic* scores: I scored over 100,000 points for one
        mission.
    *   the Tour IV & Tour V medals are only displayed if you installed
        a mission disk.
    *   For simplicity I chose to display 24 missions for each tour, the 
        actual number of missions per tour are as follows:
            Tour I:     12
            Tour II:    12
            Tour III:   14
            Tour IV:    20
        However on tour IV (Imperial Pursuit) there are four missions
        where you are given a choice of missions.  Since X-Wing will
        ignore extra scores and takes the first score of a optional
        mission I was not overly concerned about this.


Known Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~

NONE!  But if you can find one let me know: I'll treat the first 10
genuine reports of a bug as a œ10 registration (see above) and will send
you the latest (fixed) version of PFE as soon as it is finished.  Bug
reports may be sent to the address given in the Registration section of
this document.
